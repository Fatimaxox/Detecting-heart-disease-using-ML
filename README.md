# Cardiovascular Disease Prioritization with Machine Learning

For life to be sustained, it is vital that we have a healthy heart, which pumps blood throughout our bodies. Lifestyle, diet, physical activity, and medical conditions can all affect the heart's vital functions. Understanding these factors is essential for diagnosing Cardiovascular Diseases (CVDs), encompassing complications such as heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and angina. People with cardiovascular diseases face a serious threat to their well-being, to healthcare systems, and to society at large.

Detection and treatment of heart disease are urgently needed in light of the profound impact of the disease. However, the mismanagement of cases due to inadequate prioritization can burden healthcare systems and result in avoidable loss of human life. Enhancing patient outcomes hinges on early detection and treatment, a challenge given the subtle symptoms and limited patient data.

## Machine Learning Algorithms Used:
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Random Forest (RF)
- Logistic Regression (LR)

## Dataset:
The dataset comprised health data from 1190 patients, collected using 12 distinct features. The presence of heart disease was indicated by a binary value, with zero representing a normal patient and one indicating the patient was at risk of heart disease.

## Optimization Technique:
Optimization was performed using the GridSearchCV technique.

## Best Results:
The best results were obtained with the Random Forest (RF) classifier, achieving an accuracy of 96.07%.

This project aims to contribute to earlier intervention and prevention of heart disease, leveraging machine learning to save lives and alleviate societal and healthcare burdens associated with cardiovascular complications.
